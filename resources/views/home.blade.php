						Hammer Home The Glucose® has been into this for over five (5) years now and has visited many

						Hammer Home the Glucose® is founded and headed by Joakin C. Nwaokoro, a well trained and
						Certified Diabetes Educator, who has worked in Malta, New York, Canada and London England. He
						has also studied and obtained many degrees in different areas of discipline. In addition, Hammer

						as dieticians,
						nurse educators, physiotherapists, endocrinologists, and still expecting more concerned
						professionals to be involved. </h6>

					<h2 class="title">WHO WILL SEND US</h2>
					<h5>Hammer Home The Glucose is asking people to send us to different places in Nigeria to
						screen people
						for diabetes and blood pressure and treat those who are already affected with diabetes. We are
						people committed to alleviating
						the disease burden and offering a new hope to people affected and afflicted with diabetes. We
						are asking state governments to send us, individuals, organisations, politicians and groups to send us to different locations and
						zones in Nigeria. <br>

						This is the time to send us, the havoc diabetes has caused and still causing in our society
						demands the urgency of now because of the rise in disease burden.
						That is why we are asking you to send us to save a leg from getting amputated,
						send us to save an eye(s) from getting blind, send us to save a kidney from failing,
						send us to prevent a heart attack. Send us now to prevent someone from dying untimely. <br>


						There is no better and greater gift or love than saving a life from untimely death.
						They are GOD’s children created equal with potentials to live,
						to love and be loved like you and me. Hammer Home The Glucose is taking the lead by standing on
						the gap asking and pleading
						that you send us to save souls from dying. The life we save today may be the person who will
						change the next generation to come.
						Let your name be written in the sand of history that you made a difference. Let the generations
						to come appreciate that you save their
						grandfather or grandmother for them to be begotten. Be part of this course and partner with us.
						Send us now for a good reason which
						will remain indelible in the sands of time. Posterity will remember that you have sent us today
						and GOD will bless your generation and
						next to come. <br>

						Thank you <br><br>

						Nwaokoro Joakin Chidozie <br>
						President, Hammer Home The Glucose.</h5>
